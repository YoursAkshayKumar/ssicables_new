								RG188 Coax Cable is a 50-ohm coax cable used in a variety of applications including direct burial applications. Due to its temperature range of -55°C to 250°C, RG188 coax cable can be used for high-temperature applications and communication systems that require higher sequences and lower attenuation. It is also used in the transmission of data signals in applications such as LAN/WAN or GPS situations where high-temperature performance is needed. RG188 coax cable features a silver-covered copper-clad steel inner conductor that is rated for a maximum of 1,200 volts. This conductor is shielded in order to prevent electrical interference, guaranteeing an excellent and consistent current. RG188 coax cable is military-approved and features a Type VIIA PTFE jacket as specified by MIL-C-17. The only notable difference between RG188 coax cable and RG188A coax cable is that the former has a slightly larger nominal outer diameter. SSI Cables offers RG 188 Coax cable. SSI Cables RG 188 coax cable. SSI Cables Export RG 188 Coax Cable.</p>

							<p style="text-align:justify">It has been around for a long time as a technology (since the early 20th century) and has many singular advantages for reliable, accurate transmission. It also has limitations that will cause it to be replaced in some cases by fiber optic cable, category cable or, sometimes, by wireless signals.</p>

							<p style="text-align:justify">The key to the coaxial cable's success has been its shielded design, which allows the cable's copper core to transmit data quickly, without succumbing to interference or damage from environmental factors.</p>


                            <p style="text-align:justify"> SSI Cables and Wires offer RG 188 Coax cable. SSI Cables and Wires Manufactures RG 188  coax cable.
